# Regression-miles-per-galon-1970

# Project Aimed:
This project is made as an analysis for the prediction of duel efficiency of late-1970s and early-1980s automobiles. To do this, we'll provide the model with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like: cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

# Pre-Requisites:
Basic about Python3
Some of the Python Libraries
1.  numpy           "https://numpy.org/"
2.  pandas          "https://pypi.org/project/pandas/"
3.  seaborn         "https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/"
4.  pathlib         "https://pypi.org/project/pathlib/"
5.  matplotlib      "https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/"
6.  tensorflow      "https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/"

# Installation:
There are some steps for installation
1.  Install Python3.                        "https://www.python.org/downloads/"
2.  Download and Install Anaconda Toolkit   "https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual"  
3.  Install Jupyter Notebook.                         
4.  Install all the libraries above mentioned by using "pip install library_name".
5.  Download the project. Run it in your system.


# Dataset:
In the given dataset there are following columns such as MPG, Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, weight, acceleration, Model Year, Origin.

Note: The dataset is downloaded from UCI dataset repository: "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data".

# Algorithm:
We used a Deep Learning model using keras of tensorflow, we used 3 Dense layers(Two of them having the activation function as relu from tensorflow neural network), The model is Sequential, and for this particular Regression problem can be deemed a great solution.
